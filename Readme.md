# The next task to be completed

Store the username in a json file
On the react side
Re organise the Profile section in react
To make it more readable

# What I have done so far

Created a Google button at the bottom of the react display
Once the button is clicked
It asks you to login with google
Then runs a check to see if a record was saved in db
if record was saved before then it prints to console
if record was not saved it then saves it to db
Created the Login Folder
Created an Input and Form component

# Known bugs

-   Screen flashes when you are trying to enter your username or password
-   It is not saving memories based on the current username
-   It doesn't print the correct memory for the current username
