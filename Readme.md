# The next task to be completed
Create a sign in form on the home page
The info on the form will then be saved to the db

You will first be presented by a sign in page
If you try to sign in 
The record is not in db it will redirect you to a register page

# What I have done so far 
Created a Google button at the bottom of the react display
Once the button is clicked
It asks you to login with google
Then runs a check to see if a record was saved in db
if record was saved before then it prints to console
if record was not saved it then saves it to db
Created the Login Folder
Created an Input and Form component
