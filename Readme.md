What needs to be done next:
Create the frontend
The react side called client
On the client side
create a form for login in
under that create a button for login in with google
this info gets passed to express

Start by getting the google button right first on react to pass to express

What I have done so far:
I have gotten the google strategy right to login and out
It stores the information in mongodb atlas database
