# The next task to be completed
Store the username in a json file
On the react side
Re organise the Profile section in react
To make it more readable

# What I have done so far 
Created a Google button at the bottom of the react display
Once the button is clicked
It asks you to login with google
Then runs a check to see if a record was saved in db
if record was saved before then it prints to console
if record was not saved it then saves it to db
Created the Login Folder
Created an Input and Form component
